When we were kids, we would spend hours working. Now, we don't have enough hours in the day. Despite working 90,000 hours in our lives... we work on things that don't matter, we do not use our time efficiently. 

Executives especially have this problem, impacting the people and organizations they lead. Their assistants are the most over-worked and under-appreciated people in any organization. 

We believe that great software begins with an understanding of human behavior. We believe that people are dying the death of a thousand cuts in their work lives. We all need a solution. 

Our team has deep experience in enterprise, consumer, and mobile products. We've all built products and scaled them to millions of daily active users with hundreds of millions in revenue. 

In the future, an assistant sending a plethora of e-mails to coordinate lunch or an executive mentally overloaded will be a thing of the past. Technology will finally provide real context and enrich our relationships without the gargantuan effort needed now. We want to see a world where everyone gets the mental luxury of an assistant, including the assistant. We are making this future happen. 

We have top-tier investors, but more importantly, our team has put our own money and time in a market we believe will change the world. 

We run the gamut of iOS/Android and javascript on the front end, but we also use OCaml on the back-end. 

We are located on University Avenue in the heart of Palo Alto, down the street from Stanford. We'd love to meet you, regardless of where you currently live. We're also willing to fly you in for an interview -especially since we don't believe answering a few trivia questions makes you a great team member. Oh, did we mention every team member gets an assistant? 

We are in this for the long haul. We are not your typical SF startup. We believe that humanity will change for the better if we make technology serve us, not distract us. 

Let's get back to work.
